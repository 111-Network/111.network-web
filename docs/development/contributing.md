# Contributing Guide

## Development Workflow

### Spec-Driven Development

1. **Read the spec** - Before implementing, read the relevant specification in `docs/specs/`
2. **Review ADRs** - Check `docs/adr/` for architectural decisions
3. **Implement** - Build the feature according to the spec
4. **Test** - Write tests to verify the implementation matches the spec
5. **Document** - Update documentation if needed

### Git Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Write/update tests
4. Ensure all tests pass
5. Submit a pull request

### Code Standards

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use ESLint and Prettier (configuration TBD)
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep components small and focused

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the project's code standards
2. Update documentation if your changes affect it
3. Write a clear PR description
4. Reference related issues or specs
5. Request review from maintainers
