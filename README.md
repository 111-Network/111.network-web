## Our Mission

We believe **everyone deserves a way to speak, share, and connect**, no matter where they are, what they have, or whether the internet is working.

This project is building a **global message network** that doesn't rely on companies, governments, or infrastructure. It runs on **people, not servers**. It works with phones, small devices, radios, and anything else that can carry a message.

---

## 💬 How It Works

### 1. A Daily Shout to the World

Each person can send **Limited public messages per day**.

You choose what to say and roughly where you are (exact or general). That message shows up on a **world map** for everyone to see.

It's like a pin on a global bulletin board — **your voice, shared freely**.

---

### 2. Private, Secure Conversations

You can also message people **directly**.

- Only you and the other person can read what's sent. **No one else!**
- Messages take a smart route, hopping between nearby phones or small devices until they find a way to the intended user.
- Messages arrive eventually. **The more users in the network, the faster and wider the range!**

---

### 3. Works Without the Internet

**No bars? No Wi-Fi? No problem.**

- Messages can travel through phones, laptops, plug-in devices, even homemade tools.
- If someone nearby is connected to the internet, they help move messages for others too.
- Delivery might take minutes or hours, even days — but they keep traveling until they reach their owner or the world map.

### 4. Use It Anonymously — Or with Your Name

- You don't need to sign up. **Just open the app and go.**
- Want to find your friends later? You can add an email or phone number anytime to reconnect.
- **You stay in control** of your identity and privacy.

---

### 5. Sends Messages Any Way It Can

This network is **smart and flexible**.

Messages are packed so they can travel via:
- 📻 Radios
- 📱 Phones
- 📧 Email
- 🛰️ Satellite tools (like Garmin or Starlink)
- More to come later

---

### 6. Optional Little Devices

To grow the network, people can use **tiny gadgets**:
- A plug that goes into a phone
- A solar-powered box on a roof
- Anyone can make a device!

These boost signal range, connect distant areas, or keep messages flowing during a blackout.

They're **optional, cheap, and help everyone**.
